<h1>From Home to Home</h1>
<h2>Instead of a heaven, I believe in a place... Every year around Christmas time, I would have a dream, a dream about a place. I don’t recognize this place, but I feel like I should. It’s like a farm that’s covered with animals. There were horses, cats, dogs, pigs, everything. I look around trying to figure out where I am. I finally realized I was in the place that I never thought existed. I was in the place for the lost.
   “I never thought it would be this cool” I thought to myself. It was like a home. Everyone was free and happy. There was enough food for an eternity. For every animal was in peace. I didn’t know every animal, but just seeing them happy made me feel a deep connection.
   The next year I had the same dream, but more emotional. I had lost a cat who I loved deeply. The dream was different this time. It was snowing. The field was empty. Nothing was the same. I saw a barn in the distance. It was a red and yellow barn. I walked over to the barn and I opened the big white doors and I saw something that was shocking to my eyes.
   It was Bearcat. My cat that died was in the barn. He looked so relaxed and happy. When he saw me, he ran to me. I held him in my arms, just like the day I lost him. I then realized the field was never empty, they were all in the barn keeping him company.
   When I woke up from my dream that year, I realized that it was not just a dream. It meant something. The dream I had was sending me a message to share with the world. I just can’t tell it yet.
   The next night I had a different dream. It was Bearcat and he was talking to me. We had a conversation over cat food and milk. He said to me “you only did what was best for the both of us. Sometimes it might not feel like it, but I am happy here. I love seeing you in your dreams. Please know that this place is real, you just have to look closer.”
  The next night I fell asleep, but I did not see him. The horses told me he was moving from home to home. “When you look for him, look inside the box.” He gave me a heart shaped box with a map of where he went. Inside were just squiggly lines all over the place.
  I did not understand, so I took a nap, hoping to find him in a different dream. My dream was a little scary this time. I saw Bearcat, but I also saw people. I recognized them as lost family members. I want to know where I am.
  Every night I would dream of this new place. It was the place with my family and pets. The people and pets are never forgotten or lost. They know where to find me, in my dreams. They say this place is real,
I believe that is true. Where to find them is the question, and the answer is within.
  I fall asleep and dream another dream. When I enter my dream I start looking for clues. I start asking around. The first person I see is my grandma. I say to her “what clue is one to be found.” She gave me a note which read: “Somewhere deep inside, you will uncover where we hide.”
  I knew it was inside something. Maybe the heart shaped box. I fall asleep and ask for the box. When I opened the box it was empty except for a clue. The note read: “Last but not least, your love has increased. So turn around and go back to the start, because everything comes from the heart.”
 I just noticed it started with the box as my first clue. It was shaped like a heart. The map was a heart with squiggly lines. The box was my heart and the lines were my arteries. The clues on paper, I added them together. My dream was telling me that they live in a place called my heart.
  I want you to know that whenever you lose a pet or family member, just remember that they are not gone or forgotten, they just moved from home to home, from your mind and eyes, into your heart.
